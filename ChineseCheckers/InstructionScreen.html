The aim is to race all of one's pieces to the opposite side of the board before
your opponents do the same. Each player has 10 pieces. Players take turns
moving a single piece either by moving one step in any direction to an 
adjacent empty space or by jumping in one or any number of available 
consecutive hops over other single pieces.  A player may not combine hopping
with a single-step move, for a move consists of one or the other. Turns 
proceed counterclockwise.
